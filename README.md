# Footprint-Scanner

Build RTL-SDR on your Mac: https://gist.github.com/jheasly/9477732

Usage for rtl-power, included in rtl-sdr:

We still should try and get rtl-power-fftw working, since it is much faster apparently. But this should work for this week.

To Do:

1. GUI for stream captures
2. Python stream the data to a quick processor for an immediate view of the situation
3. Estimate 'loudness' of the footprint with the given data.
